"""What a call cost, given what it used.

Used by ``UsageTracker`` and ``BudgetAlerter``. Returning a consistent cost from
one place prevents drift between "what we tracked" and "what we budgeted".

The rates themselves are a fact about the provider's catalogue, so they come from
``opendde_harness.providers.rates``; what lives here is the arithmetic on top of them --
including Anthropic's ephemeral cache pricing, which is a billing rule rather
than a rate:

    cache read  -> 10% of prompt rate
    cache write -> 125% of prompt rate (ephemeral 5-min TTL)

Non-Anthropic providers (no cache support) pass ``cache_read_tokens=0``,
``cache_write_tokens=0`` and the function collapses to the standard formula.
