"""CLI assembly helper for the plugin / memory-backend stack.

Two functions that bridge the gap between OpenDDEHarnessConfig (user-facing
settings under ``plugins`` / ``memory``) and the runtime objects
AgentLoop expects (a ready-to-use :class:`MemoryBackend` instance):

- :func:`build_plugin_registry` — discover all installed plugins
  (bundled + user-level + project-level + pip entry points), filter
  by ``config.plugins.disabled``, return an activated registry.
- :func:`maybe_build_memory_backend` — resolve ``config.memory.backend``
  to a concrete :class:`MemoryBackend` instance via the registry, or
  return ``None`` when no backend is selected / the requested
  contribution isn't available.

Both functions are intentionally lenient: a missing
plugin / activation error logs a warning and falls through to ``None``
rather than crashing the host. The legacy ``self.memory`` pipeline in
AgentLoop is unaffected — it always works regardless of whether a
plugin backend is wired.

Lifecycle (``backend.start()`` / ``backend.stop()``) is the **caller's**
responsibility. These helpers only construct; CLI bootstrap code does
the await around them.
