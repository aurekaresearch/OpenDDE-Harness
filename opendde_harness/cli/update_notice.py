"""Startup update nudge for the TUI status bar.

The status bar's right slot shows an "update available" hint in place of the
cwd/branch label when the session init bundle carries ``update_available`` /
``update_command`` (see ``ui-tui/src/components/appChrome.tsx``); this module
is what fills those in.

The live check reads the release page redirect (not the releases API, whose
unauthenticated quota is 60 requests per hour per IP -- a daily check from every
install behind one egress is enough to drain it, and a nudge must not cost the
budget that ``ddeharness upgrade`` needs). It is still too slow for the session-create
hot path, so we keep a small cache in the runtime cache dir and refresh it in a
daemon thread at most once a day. A launch therefore shows the notice based on the
*cached* latest version; the first launch after a release lands refreshes the cache
and the notice appears on the next launch. Any network or parse failure is
swallowed -- an update nudge must never break startup.

Set ``OPENDDE_HARNESS_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`` to opt out of both the fetch and the hint.
