"""Hard-exit past CPython interpreter finalization.

Finalizing the interpreter while native state is still live can segfault
(``Py_FinalizeEx``; SIGSEGV, exit 139) and mask the real exit code. The only
caller today is the pytest session hook (``tests/conftest.py``), where a fully
green run was observed exiting 139 on Linux.

This used to also gate ``opendde_harness.cli.commands.run`` on a live lancedb background
thread. That gate is gone: nothing under ``opendde_harness/`` imports lancedb -- memory
talks to the memory service over HTTP and it runs out-of-process -- so the probe could
not fire in any configuration.
