"""Atomic operations for LLM provider config sections.

This module is the ONLY write path for provider configuration. All entry
points (CLI commands, future wizard, future REPL slash) must call
functions defined here. Direct ``load_config`` / ``save_config`` on the
providers section is forbidden -- see plan rule.

OAuth providers have a separate auth path via
``provider_commands._LOGIN_HANDLERS`` and keep their credentials in files under
``~/.opendde_harness/oauth``, not in ``config.json``. ``set_provider_fields`` refuses to
write ``api_key`` for those providers; callers must invoke ``provider login`` for
that. ``reset_provider`` handles both cases: schema-default rewrite for config
fields, plus deleting the credential files when the provider has
``is_oauth=True``.
