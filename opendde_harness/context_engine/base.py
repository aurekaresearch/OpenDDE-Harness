"""ContextEngine ABC — contract for the context engine.

This package (``opendde_harness.context_engine``) hosts the single
:class:`ContextAssembler` (a concrete subclass of
:class:`ContextEngine`) plus its building blocks. AgentLoop holds
exactly one ``self.context_engine: ContextEngine`` reference, built via
:func:`opendde_harness.context_engine.build_context_engine`. The ABC is kept so
alternative engines can be slotted in for experiments, but there is one
shipping implementation.

Naming note:
    Named ``context_engine`` (not ``context``) to mirror the L4
    ``memory_engine`` package and to avoid colliding with
    :mod:`opendde_harness.agent.context`, which hosts the lower-level
    :class:`ContextBuilder` utility that engines use as a building block.

Layering note:
    The data carriers ``AssembledContext`` and ``TokenBudget`` live in
    :mod:`opendde_harness.memory_engine.base` (they were placed there before
    this ABC landed). The two engines (``MemoryEngine``,
    ``ContextEngine``) are peer L4 abstractions; the dataclasses are
    shared value objects, not part of either's contract surface.
