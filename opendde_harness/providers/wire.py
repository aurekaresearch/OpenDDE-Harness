"""Storage form to wire form: the one place a stored model id becomes a sent one.

A model id is written down in one shape and sent in another. `openrouter/x` is
stored with its gateway named so the picker and the router agree on who serves
it, but MiniMax's own client wants the prefix gone, LiteLLM wants the vendor it
routes on in front, and Azure wants the bare deployment name because the id
lands in a URL path.

That conversion used to be spelled at each client. The spellings drifted: the
standard path grew a canonicalizer for prefixes written in a former or
hyphenated spelling and the gateway path never got one, so a local deployment
addressed as "hosted-vllm/..." came out double-prefixed. Collapsing the two
here is what made that one fix rather than two, and it is fixed --
`tests/data/wire_model_baseline.json` records the single-prefix result.

So callers ask here rather than building the prefix themselves -- an invariant
test keeps `model_prefix` / `skip_prefixes` readable only by this module and the
two that decompose an id rather than build one.

The module owns both directions, because they are one contract seen from two
ends. Outbound is `wire_model`. Inbound -- what id to write down when a user
picks a model -- is `stored_model_id`, and identity between two written ids is
`merge_key`.

Inbound had the same history and a worse symptom. Two implementations decided
what to store, and they disagreed for most providers: picking a model in the
TUI wrote `glm-4.6` while picking the same one in the wizard wrote `zai/glm-4.6`.
Both landed in the same list, so the list held one model twice and removing
either spelling left the other -- deletion reported success and changed nothing.
Comparing by `merge_key` rather than by string is what makes that impossible.
