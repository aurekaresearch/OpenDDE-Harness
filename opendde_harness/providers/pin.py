"""Which provider ``agents.defaults.provider`` should name after a model change.

The pin overrides what a model id says, so a stale one silently sends the new
model's request to the old vendor -- with the old vendor's key. The rule lives
here so the TUI picker and the CLI answer the same way, rather than the CLI
telling the user to edit the field by hand.

The four cases, and why each is what it is:

======================  ==========================================================
a provider was named    that provider. The picker always sends one, and a
                        ``--provider`` flag is the user saying it outright.
the id names a vendor    that vendor's spec. The id is evidence and it is
we carry a spec for      unambiguous.
the id is prefixed but   ``auto``. Keeping the old pin would hand its key to a
we have no spec for it   vendor it does not belong to; auto-detection is the
                        honest answer for "somebody, not necessarily who you had".
a bare id                ask the pinned provider whether it serves this model,
                        and keep the pin only if it does -- see
                        ``resolve_bare_against_pin``.

    evidence is the provider currently pinned.

    Rather than guess, ask whether that provider serves the model: its own curated
    list first, then the catalogue. If it does, the pin was right and stays. A local
    deployment stays too without asking -- its server names whatever models it
    likes, and there is no key to mis-route.

    With no such evidence the pin is not kept: it would send one vendor's key to
    another, the mis-routing the prefix rules exist to prevent. Returning None
    leaves the caller to say so rather than pick a vendor on the user's behalf.
