"""What a model is called and what it is for, for the surfaces people read.

A picker showing `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6` is showing an identifier. What a
person choosing a model wants is its name, roughly what it is good at, how much
context it takes and how recent it is -- none of which LiteLLM's table carries,
because that table exists to price and route.

So there are two catalogue sources and they answer different questions:

* LiteLLM's own table decides prices and limits used in a request. It ships with
  the dependency and needs no network. It also carries capability flags, which
  OpenDDE Harness deliberately does not read: its `supports_prompt_caching` asks whether a
  model caches at all, while what a request needs to know is whether the provider
  accepts `cache_control` blocks -- `ProviderSpec`'s field of the same name.
* the models.dev snapshot decides labels, and prices a finished call. It carries
  a name, a one-line description, and the vendor's published cost per model.
  Context windows and capability flags are deliberately absent: those shape the
  *next* request -- a window sizes trimming, a flag picks a wire shape -- and a
  second source for them is a second answer.

Keeping the split is the point rather than an implementation detail. The snapshot
is community-maintained data; if it goes stale, wrong, or missing, the cost is a
model shown by its id instead of its name, or a total that is off. It can never
cause a wrong request, because nothing that shapes one reads it.

The snapshot ships with OpenDDE Harness so a fresh install labels models offline and tests
never reach the network. Regenerate with
``scripts/refresh_models_dev_snapshot.py``.
