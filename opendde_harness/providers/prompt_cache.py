"""Whether a request may carry Anthropic-shaped ``cache_control`` breakpoints.

One question, asked from three places -- the provider that builds the request,
and the two token strategies that place breakpoints before it. It used to be
answered by a copy of the same function in each, which is how the copies came to
disagree: the provider's only ever marked the system message and the tool list,
so fixing it there could not have changed what the strategies stamp onto the last
conversation message, and that is where the doubling came from.

The answer is **(wire x model family)**, not the wire alone:

* the wire has to have somewhere to put the field. An OpenAI-shaped API does
  not, and a gateway speaks its own shape regardless of who it fronts, so
  ``ProviderSpec.supports_prompt_caching`` is asked of whatever the request is
  actually addressed to.
* the model has to be one whose vendor reads it. A gateway accepts the field for
  every model it fronts and forwards it to vendors that do not: it is then billed
  as an unrecognized block rather than refused, which doubles a prompt silently.

Suppression is the fourth answer, and it is learned rather than declared,
because no table here can predict it. See ``suppress``.

    False for an empty id, for a wire with nowhere to put the field, for a model
    whose vendor does not read it, and for anything an upstream has already
    rejected it for.

    ``addressed_to`` is the provider actually serving the request, for the one
    caller that knows it independently of the id. A stored id names its provider,
    so the two normally agree -- but a bare ``anthropic/claude-...`` handed to a
    SiliconFlow client reads as Anthropic's wire from the id alone, and that wire
    has nowhere to put the field. Passing it keeps the answer about the request
    rather than about the string.

    A ``addressed_to`` naming a provider OpenDDE Harness carries no spec for (Bedrock,
    Vertex, a bare LiteLLM passthrough) resolves to nothing, and so does
    ``find_by_model`` on an id whose prefix nobody claims -- in both cases there
    is no spec to ask, not a spec that said no. Falling through to
    ``find_by_keywords`` there guesses the wire's dialect from the model's own
    name instead of giving up: Bedrock speaks Anthropic's ``cache_control``
    natively (translated to ``cachePoint`` on the way out) for exactly the ids
    that mention "claude", so the guess is right far more often than a blanket
    False would be. A guess is what it is, though -- wrong for a model renamed
    away from its vendor's naming, or a passthrough that fronts a wire this
    guess did not anticipate -- which is why ``suppress`` exists: an upstream
    rejection is learned at runtime and this guess never gets a second try for
    that model. Resolving *to* a spec, by contrast, is left exactly as strict as
    before -- that path is what stopped a gateway forwarding the field to a
    vendor that bills it as an unrecognized block instead of refusing it.
