        instance, which is right when one instance can reach every hop --

        handing it the full chain would send every fallback model to the
        *primary* model's endpoint. Instead, ``_pick`` runs per hop, and each
        hop's own ``chat_with_retry`` is called with ``fallback_models=[]``
        so it keeps its own retry ladder without also retrying other hops'
        endpoints.

        Continuation between hops mirrors ``LLMProvider.chat_with_retry``:
        move to the next hop only on an error classified ``should_fallback``
        with a hop remaining; otherwise the response is returned as-is.

        The ``can_serve`` skip and the cache_control strip also mirror that
        loop (see ``LLMProvider.chat_with_retry``): a per-model sub-provider
        picked for a later hop can be just as unable to serve it, or just as
        unable to read a cache marker set for the primary model's vendor, as
