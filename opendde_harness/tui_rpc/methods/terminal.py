"""``terminal.resize`` RPC handler — record cols, return ok.

ui-tui's ``useMainApp.ts:426`` calls ``terminal.resize`` with the new
``{cols, rows}`` payload whenever Ink observes a SIGWINCH; the call is
fire-and-forget. We need a handler that:

  1. Never raises (so the SIGWINCH burst doesn't spam errors), and
  2. Optionally records the latest ``cols`` so ``cli.dispatch`` can use it
     as the Rich console width on its next invocation (a future-proofing
     hook — ``cli_dispatch.py`` does not yet read this value, but the wire
     is in place for v0.2).

The recorded state is module-level (a single TUI subprocess has exactly one
terminal, so a singleton is correct).
