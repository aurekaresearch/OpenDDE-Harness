"""``model.*`` RPC handlers — backend for the TUI ``/model`` v1 picker.

Eight methods drive the picker:

* ``model.options`` — current model/provider + one row per provider.
* ``model.save_key`` — store an api_key (+ optional api_base) for a provider.
* ``model.disconnect`` — clear a provider's stored credentials.
* ``model.add_model`` / ``model.remove_model`` — edit a provider's curated
  model list.
* ``model.endpoints`` / ``model.add_endpoint`` / ``model.remove_endpoint`` —
  edit the several url/key groups one provider section can carry, each write
  answering with the refreshed (key-redacted) list.

All write helpers live in ``opendde_harness.config.update_providers`` (the single
write path for provider config); the handlers wrap the synchronous calls in
``asyncio.to_thread`` so the event loop is not blocked on disk IO. OAuth
providers cannot have keys written from the picker — that is gated to
``ddeharness provider login`` and surfaced as -32012.
