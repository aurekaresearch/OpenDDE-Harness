"""Plugin runtime context.

A factory (the ``module.path:callable`` named in a manifest) receives
exactly one :class:`PluginContext`. From it, the factory pulls:

- ``config``  — the plugin's own config slice from OpenDDEHarnessConfig, passed
  through verbatim. The manifest's ``config_schema`` is parsed but NOT
  validated and its defaults are NOT applied (see EM-2); a plugin must
  supply its own defaults in code.
- ``services`` — a :class:`ServiceLocator` exposing only the host
  services a backend is allowed to touch. The locator is intentionally
  narrow so plugins don't grow ambient dependencies on arbitrary host
  internals — every field here is a deliberate capability grant.
- ``logger`` — a logger pre-bound with ``plugin=<id>`` so plugin output
  is grep-able in mixed logs.

The locator is a frozen dataclass: factories cannot mutate the host's
view of available services, only read from it.
