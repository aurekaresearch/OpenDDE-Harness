    """Make sure a server is answering at ``base_url``, starting one if not.

    ``base_url`` is required on purpose. It used to default to
    ``DEFAULT_MEMORY_BASE_URL``, which let the onboard wizard probe 18791 while
    the memory backend read ``plugins.config`` and used whatever address was
    configured there. On a machine that had moved the server off the default port
    the wizard then decided nothing was running, spawned a second instance, and
    that instance died on the OME jobstore lock the first one already held --
    reported to the user as a startup timeout blaming a missing install. A default
    here means "forgot to read the config" is a silent runtime bug rather than a
    signature error, so there is none.

    ``timeout`` is a budget for how long a caller is willing to make the user
    wait, not a failure detector. Once the poll loop watches the child's exit
    code, a boot that cannot succeed is reported in about a second regardless of
    this value, so the only thing left to size is the wait itself. Overrunning it
    is cheap: the child keeps booting, this session goes without long-term
    memory, and the next one finds a healthy server -- so a small budget costs at
    most one session and heals itself, while a large one blocks every first
    session of a machine's uptime. Measured cold start on a small store is
    around two seconds.

    ``on_proc`` receives the spawned child the moment it exists, so a caller
    still holds it when this function goes on to raise.

    ``on_wait`` fires once, only when an actual boot is about to be waited on --
    never when a server is already answering. That lets a caller narrate the
    wait without adding noise to the common case where there is nothing to wait
    for.
