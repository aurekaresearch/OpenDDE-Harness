"""Empty-response recovery for the agent loop.

Pure decision logic, no I/O — the loop owns the side effects (appending
messages, incrementing counters, ``continue``). Kept separate from the loop so
the branching can be unit-tested in isolation, mirroring the repo's other small
policy units (nudge_policy, decision_router).

A turn that ends with no visible text would otherwise surface a canned
"no response to give" dud — a zero-score turn on weaker models. This recovers
the turn before giving up, in three bounded modes:

  PREFILL  thinking-only — the model emitted only reasoning (a structured field
           or an inline <think> block) and no body. Re-feed its own reasoning so
           it continues into the answer.
  NUDGE    post-tool empty — the model ran a tool then returned nothing. Inject a
           short user nudge so it processes the tool result.
  RETRY    plain empty — re-request as-is.

This is distinct from Sentinel's NudgeInjector / NudgePolicy, which inject
*proactive suggestions* onto an outbound reply; this module instead recovers an
empty turn before it is ever sent.
