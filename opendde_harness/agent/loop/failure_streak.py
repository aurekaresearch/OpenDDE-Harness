"""When a repeated tool failure is a stuck loop, and what to say about it.

The agent loop injects a change-approach nudge after the same tool fails the
same way several turns running. Two judgements decide whether that helps: which
failures are deterministic enough to count at all (a 429 clears itself), and
what counts as "the same failure" (two different errors mean the model is still
adapting). Both live here rather than in the loop, which only does the counting.
